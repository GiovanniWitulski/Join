    <h2>What is Join</h2>
    <div class="text-container">
        <a href="/index.html">Join</a> is a kanban-based project management tool
        designed and built by a group of dedicated students
        as part of their web development bootcamp at the
        Developer Akademie.
        <br><br>
        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a
        highly effective method to visualize work, limit
        work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).
        <a href="/index.html">Join</a> leverages the principles of kanban to help
        users manage their tasks and projects in an
        intuitive, visual interface.
        <br><br>
